# Pill dispenser

Pill dispenser consist of three main parts: controller PCB, dispenser base and dispenser wheel.
Dispenser base contains a stepper motor for turning the dispenser wheel, a piezo electric sensor for
detecting if a pill is dispensed and an optical sensor for calibrating the wheel position. Dispenser
wheel has eight compartments, seven for pills and one for calibration. The wheel has no sensors but
has an opening that can detected by the optical sensor of the base to calibrate the wheel position.

Status of the device can be communicated to the server using a LoRaWAN module. LoRaWAN is a
long-range low bandwidth radio network standard for transmitting relatively small amounts of data
at a time. LoRaWAN can be setup as a private network of bough as a service from operators.

## Wiring and pin assignments

Dispenser base has a 6-pin JST connector and a 4-pin Grove connector. Connect the JST connector to
the 6-pin connector on the stepper driver board. There is only one 6-pin connector in the system so
there is no risk of incorrect wiring. There are multiple grove connectors on the PCB. Connect the
Grove connector from dispenser base to ADC_1 connector.

LoRaWAN module is connected to UART0 connector under the stepper motor driver.

Dispenser pin assignments:

- Opto fork – GP 28 – Configure as an input with pull-up.
    o Reads zero when the opening is at the sensor.
- Piezo sensor – GP 27 – Configure as an input with pull-up.
    o There is a falling or multiple falling edges when a pill hits the sensor.
- Stepper motor controller – GP2, GP3, GP6 and GP
    o All four pins are outputs.
    o Pins are connected to the stepper motor driver pins IN1 – IN
- LoRaWAN – uses UART, can be connected to UART 1 or UART 0
    o UART0 uses GP0 and GP
       ▪ Note that UART0 is used by stdin/stdout when UART stdio is enabled so
          **LoRaWAN module should be connected to UART1.**
    o UART1 uses GP4 and GP
- LEDs
    o GP20 - GP

## Important information

### Never turn the dispenser wheel by hand!

## Piezo sensor

When a pill hits the piezo sensor, it will create one or more falling edges in the input. Note that your
program must consider the time that is takes for the pill to fall.


## Project goals

The goal of the project is to implement an automated pill dispenser that dispenses daily medicine to
a patient. The dispenser has eight compartments. One of them is used for calibrating the dispenser
wheel position leaving the other seven for pills. Dispenser wheel will turn daily at a fixed time to
dispense the daily medicine and the piezoelectric sensor will be used to confirm that pill(s) were
dispensed. The dispenser state is stored in non-volatile memory so that the state of the device
(number of pills left, daily dispensing log, etc) will persist over restarts. The state of the device is
communicated to a server using LoRaWAN network.

For testing purposes, the time between dispensing pills is reduced to 30 seconds.

## Minimum requirements

When the dispenser is started it waits for a button to be pressed and blinks an LED while waiting.
When the button is pressed the dispenser is calibrated by turning the wheel at least one full turn and
then stopping the wheel so that the compartment with the sensor opening is aligned with the drop
tube.

After calibration the program keeps the LED on until user presses another button. Then it dispenses
pills every 30 seconds starting from the button press. When the wheel is turned, the piezo sensor is
used to detect if a pill was dispensed or not. If no pill was detected the LED blinks 5 times. When all
pills have been dispensed (wheel turned 7 times) the program starts over (wait for calibration, etc.).

## Advanced requirements

Device remembers the state of the device across boot/power down.

Device connects to LoRaWAN and reports status of the device when there is a status change (boot,
pill dispensed/not dispensed, dispenser empty, power off during turning, etc.)

Device can detect if it was reset / powered off while motor was turning.

Device can recalibrate automatically after power off during middle of a turn without dispensing the
pills that remain.

## Lora communication

Always test connection to the module with ‘AT’ before executing other commands. You need to join
network before sending messages. Joining needs to be done only once so it should be done when
the device boots.

Lora commands for connecting to the network:

1. +MODE=LWOTAA
2. +KEY=APPKEY,”<hexadecimal key for your device>”
3. +CLASS=A
4. +PORT=
5. +JOIN
6. +MSG=”text message” (Can be used only after successful join)

Your program must wait for response to each of the commands. The response time varies from
command to command. You can find documentation of responses in the LoRaWAN module manual.


+JOIN command takes the longest time. It can take up to 20 seconds before response is received. Join
can also fail which means that you need to retry join.

Sending a message typically takes a long time due to the very low data rate of LoRaWAN network.
Make sure that you wait for the response before sending the message.

You can receive and display the messages that you send by using lorareceive.py from
Documents/project. The program has short instructions in comments and the beginning of the
source code.

## Documentation

The document needs to contain the following things:

- Introduction to the project
    o What are the goals of the project?
    o What is the added value of your project to dispensing pills? How can the system be
       utilized to improve quality of life or improve efficiency of (health) care?
- Description of the operating principles of the software
- Flow chart(s) that shows:
    o How the system works in general
    o How the software works
- How did you divide work between team members? Reflection of the project work.

originality check that verifies both originality and AI-usage.

Originality requirement applies also to software. Your project code will also go through
originality/plagiarism check.
